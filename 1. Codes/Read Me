1. Data Preparation
- Codes for preparing data into available format for analysis
- Two versions of sample datasets are used: 1K Sample and 100K Sample
- csv_filtered: original dataset
(1) Check_Condition
: Check the top 10 most common disorders from the conditions file
(2) CSV_Conversion
: Convert original CSV files into available format for analysis
: Leave the data of the latest day and flatten the data
(3) CSV_Merge
: Merge the converted dataset on patient_id
(4) Attribute_Selection
: Select attributes that are most common and relevant to 'viral sinusitis' and conduct feature engineering


2. Preprocessing
(1) Impute_and_Encode
: Impute missing values
: One hot encode categorical data
: Remove attributes with feature importance
(2) Feature_Importance
: Check feature importance with Gradient Boosting

3. Synthetic Data Generation
- Codes for synthetic data generation with each model
(1) CTGAN
(2) DataSynthesizer
(3) VAE
(4) GaussianCopula
(5) CopulaGAN

4. Noise Addition
- AdaptiveNoise
: Add noise to a synthetic dataset
: Laplace noise for continuous variables, salt-and-pepper noise for binary columns
: Adaptive noise using feature importance

5. Model Evaluation
(1) DataEvaluation
: Compare synthetic data with real data
: Attribute distribution, correlation matrix, clustering, etc.
(2) Privacy_Utility
: Check privacy vs utility trade-off
: Calculate predictive performance (ROC AUC) while changing privacy level (epsilon)
(3) Prediction_Comparison
: Compare the predictive performance of the synthetic dataset with the original dataset
: Confusion matrix, ROC curve
